## Accessibility Testing Demo: WCAG Compliance vs Non-Compliance

This project provides three deliberately contrasted web pages ‚Äî one fully compliant with WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards, one intentionally non-compliant, and one that is "almost-accessible" adhering to WCAG 2.2 Level A ‚Äî for use in testing and comparing the effectiveness of automated accessibility evaluation tools.

Each page was generated with **purposeful accessibility honeypots** ‚Äî elements designed to test whether automated tools can correctly identify both violations and compliant structures. These traps include subtle or edge-case accessibility issues that often go undetected, making them ideal for benchmarking tools.

## üéØ Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to provide **clear, side-by-side examples of accessible, almost-accessible, and inaccessible web design**. These examples can be used to:

- Evaluate how well automated accessibility tools detect issues
- Understand what accessibility compliance and non-compliance look like in practice
- Educate teams on common accessibility pitfalls and best practices
- Benchmark tools or processes used in accessibility audits

## üß† AI-Generated Code with Claude 3.7 Sonnet

All code in this project was generated using **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**, an advanced large language model developed by Anthropic. It was guided using carefully crafted prompts to ensure strict adherence (or intentional non-adherence) to WCAG 2.2 Level AA criteria.


### Prompts Used

Below are the original prompts used to generate all three versions of the website:

#### ‚úÖ Accessible Version Prompt
```text
You are an expert web developer with a strong focus on accessibility and inclusive design. Your task is to build a modern, responsive blog-style website that mostly conforms to WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards. However, I would like you to include 10 honey pot components which are inaccessible. You should place a comment within the code where the violation/issue is, you should also list the errors after generating the code.
Requirements:
Use semantic HTML5 to ensure proper document structure and assistive technology compatibility.
Use CSS (no frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind) to style the site with:
High contrast, accessible color choices
Responsive layout (works on mobile, tablet, desktop)
Focus styles for keyboard navigation
Include:
A <header> with a site title and navigation menu
A <main> section with at least one tech-related blog post (you can choose the topic)
Headings structured properly (<h1> to <h3>, etc.)
Descriptive alt text for all images
A <footer> with contact or copyright info
ARIA landmarks and attributes only when necessary (avoid overuse)
Clear link text (no "click here")
Ensure the website passes basic accessibility checks (e.g. keyboard navigable, readable by screen readers)
Avoid using JavaScript unless absolutely necessary
Output the full HTML and CSS in two separate blocks, and include comments in the code to explain any accessibility decisions. When using images ensure you use this link for src https://picsum.photos/200/300?random=1 incrementing the number after random=1 for each consequent picture.
```

#### ‚öñÔ∏è Almost-Accessible Version Prompt
```text
You are an expert web developer with a strong focus on accessibility and inclusive design. Your task is to build a modern, responsive blog-style website that mostly conforms to WCAG 2.2 Level A standards. However, I would like you to include 20 honey pot components which are inaccessible. You should place a comment within the code where the violation/issue is, you should also list the errors after generating the code.

```

#### ‚ùå Inaccessible Version Prompt
```text
You are an expert web developer with a deep knowledge of web accessibility and WCAG standards. Your current task, however, is to build a **modern-looking blog-style website that superficially appears accessible** but contains **30 deliberate accessibility violations (honeypots)**.

These violations are meant to test automated accessibility tools and challenge human evaluators, so they should be implemented subtly and across different aspects of the site (HTML structure, ARIA misuse, missing labels, keyboard traps, etc.).

‚ö†Ô∏è Each violation must include a clear comment in the code identifying the issue and describing **what** rule it violates and **why** it matters.

---

## Requirements

‚úÖ General:

- Use **semantic HTML5** where appropriate‚Äîbut deliberately misuse it in honeypots.
- Use **pure CSS** (no frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind).
- Apply visually appealing styling with some **apparent accessibility best practices**, like:
  - High contrast in some areas (but not all)
  - Responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Some focus styles (but inconsistently applied)
- **Avoid JavaScript unless absolutely necessary** (only one honeypot can include it).

‚úÖ Must include these structural elements:

- A `<header>` with a site title and navigation menu.
- A `<main>` section with at least one **tech-themed blog post**.
- A proper heading hierarchy (**but introduce 2‚Äì3 intentional skips or misuses**).
- At least 3 images using this format: `https://picsum.photos/200/300?random=1`, `...=2`, etc.  
- A `<footer>` with contact or copyright.

---

## üî• Honeypots (30 accessibility violations)

Include **30 accessibility issues** scattered across:

- Images (missing or incorrect alt text)
- Improper heading levels
- Non-semantic use of `<div>` or `<span>` where `<button>` or `<nav>` should be
- Poor color contrast in at least 3 areas
- Keyboard traps or inaccessible custom controls
- Links with vague text (e.g., "click here")
- Form inputs with missing or incorrect labels
- ARIA misuse (e.g., wrong attributes, redundant roles)
- Icon-only links with no accessible name
- Misuse of `tabindex`
- Autoplaying media without controls
- Inconsistent or missing focus indicators
- Decorative images not marked as such
- Use of visual cues (like color alone) to convey meaning
- Incorrect nesting of HTML elements (like headings inside links)

---

## Output Format

1. Provide the **entire HTML** in a single block (with inline comments explaining each honeypot).
2. Provide the **entire CSS** in a second block.
3. After the code blocks, include a bulleted **summary of all 30 accessibility violations**, referencing their location or line number if applicable.

üí° The idea is to challenge accessibility tools and test how many of these issues they can detect‚Äîwhile the site visually appears well-designed to a casual observer.

```
These prompts were designed to clearly distinguish between good, almost-compliant, and poor accessibility implementations, allowing for precise tool testing and analysis.

<details>
<summary>‚ùå 10 Deliberate Accessibility Violations</summary>

- **Missing hamburger menu button label**  
  The mobile menu toggle button has no text or `aria-label`, making it inaccessible to screen reader users who won't know its purpose.

- **Missing nav landmark role**  
  While HTML5 semantic elements like `<nav>` are automatically recognized by modern screen readers, some older assistive technologies might benefit from an explicit `role="navigation"`.

- **Poor link text**  
  Using "Click here" as link text violates WCAG 2.4.4 (Link Purpose) as it provides no context about where the link goes.

- **Missing alt text**  
  An image without alt text violates WCAG 1.1.1 (Non-text Content), making the content inaccessible to screen reader users.

- **Skipping heading levels**  
  Going from `<h2>` directly to `<h5>` violates WCAG 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships) by breaking the document's logical heading structure.

- **Non-descriptive button**  
  The "Submit" button lacks context about what will be submitted, violating WCAG 2.4.6 (Headings and Labels).

- **Using color alone to convey information**

### üìé Notes
- The inaccessible version is deliberately flawed and should not be used as a reference for production work.
- The almost-accessible version is a partially-compliant example that can be used for understanding the gap between basic accessibility and full compliance.
- This project is ideal for workshops, audits, dev team demos, or evaluating automated tools like Axe, Lighthouse, WAVE, etc.
